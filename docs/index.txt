virtualenv3
===========

I bring you good news: ``virtualenv3`` is obsolete!

Thanks to the hard work of the core virtualenv team,
the main ``virtualenv`` package has gained native support for Python 3,
so ad-hoc forks of the program like this one are no longer necessary.
From this time forward,
you can simply download the mainline ``virtualenv``
and install it using your Python 3 interpreter.

Here is the real package's page on PyPI:

Enjoy!
